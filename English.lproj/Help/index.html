<h1>Phage</h1>

<h2>Summary and Objective</h2>

<p>Phage is an abstract strategy game played by 2 players on an 8 x 8 game board.</p>
<p>The object of the game is to make more legal moves than your opponent. Draws are possible.</p>
<p>There are a maximum 56 legal moves per gameâ€”28 per player. Each game typically lasts between 5 and 10 minutes.</p>

<h2>Playing Pieces and Movement</h2>

<p>Each player has 4 playing pieces: Circle, Diamond, Square, and Triangle. They have the following properties:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Circle can move any number of open squares along horizontal, vertical or diagonal paths.</li>
  <li>The Diamond can move any number of open squares along the horizontal or vertical paths.</li>
  <li>The Square can move any number of open squares along diagonal paths.</li>
  <li>The Triangle can move any number of open squares along a horizontal path and forwards only along the vertical. This is the least maneuverable piece.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each piece is permitted to move a maximum of just 7 times during the game. Moves are not transferable between pieces, i.e. if one piece is blocked in and has only used 4 moves, it cannot transfer its remaining 3 moves to another piece.</p>
<p>When a playing piece is moved, the square from which it moved is marked and can no longer be passed through or landed upon by either player during the remainder of the game.</p>
<p>An open square is one that has not been occupied at any point during the present game.</p>


<h2>Gameplay</h2>

<p>The following four diagrams show the first four moves of a game to illustrate how these rules apply.</p>

<p>Yellow moves the Square to H6. The threat is H6-F8, which would severely limit the movement of Red's Diamond (H8).
E3 is marked and cannot be passed through or landed upon by either player for the remainder of this game.
Note also that Yellow has marked the move on the grid to the left of the game board.
The Square playing piece now has a maximum of 6 moves left in this game.</p>
