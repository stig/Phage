    <p>A game of ruse, conquest &amp; sacrifice. Win by outwitting your
    opponent and trapping him between minefields.</p>

    </div>

    <p>Phage is an abstract strategy game for two players. This Cocoa
    implementation pits a human player against an AI.</p>
    
    <p>Each player has four pieces. Each piece moves differently and is
    able to make at most 7 moves, making for swift games&mdash;which
    means you can finish a game over a cup of tea!</p>

    <p>The interface is still a bit crude, but functional. The feature
    set is small, but as of version 0.2 you can ask the AI to suggest a
    move for you (just hit the Tools menu, then chose the "Move hint"
    option).</p>
