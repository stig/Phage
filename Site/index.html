    <p>A game of ruse, conquest &amp; sacrifice. Win by outwitting your
    opponent and trapping him between minefields.</p>

    </div>
    
    <p>Phage is an abstract strategy game for two players. This Cocoa
    implementation pits a human player against an AI.</p>
    
    <p>Each player has four pieces, each of which can make at most 7
    moves. This makes for swift games, which you can finish over a cup
    of tea!</p>

    <p><a href="@URL@">Download Phage @VERSION@</a> (0.5MB disk image),
    and start playing today! This is a Universal Binary, which should
    run on Mac OS X 10.3.9 and later. </p> 

    <p>The interface is still a bit crude, but functional. The feature
    set is small, but as of version 0.2 you can ask the AI to suggest a
    move for you (just hit the Tools menu, then chose the "Move hint"
    option).</p>
